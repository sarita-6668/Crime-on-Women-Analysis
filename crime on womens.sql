 /*Final Takeaways
ðŸ”¹ Crimes against women remain a significant issue in certain states and require stronger policies.
ðŸ”¹ Northern states have higher crime rates compared to Southern states.
ðŸ”¹ Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and West Bengal consistently rank high in reported crimes.
ðŸ”¹ State-wise crime patterns differâ€”some states report more domestic violence, while others see higher kidnapping or trafficking.
ðŸ”¹ More populated states generally report higher crimes, but factors like governance, awareness, and law enforcement play a crucial role.
